# Rule of thumb on when to use html_safe:
# If you are going to deal with user input,
# then its best not to use it. If we put our own
# content then it should be fine

# When to use a view helper and when to use a partial:
# If the logic that we are trying to implement in the 
# view is conditinals (If..else, case, etc) then we use a view helper.
# If we are implementing something like a nav bar (links or html code)
# then we can use a partial
