# Explaination of ||=
# If the item is nil, it will run the code
# In other words, when creating a new portfolio, if no main image or thumb image is given,
# set_defaults will give it a default value
# Another way of looking at it is:
# if self.main_image == nil
#   self.main_image = "https://via.placeholder.com/600x400"
# end
